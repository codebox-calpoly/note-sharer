# Note Sharer

Note Sharer is a campus‑specific marketplace where students upload high‑quality notes, Quizlet sets, syllabi, and other course resources. Contributors earn credits from uploads and upvotes, then spend those credits to access others' materials—solving the free‑rider problem and reducing reliance on paywalled platforms like Chegg or Brainly.

## Overview

### Purpose

Students struggle to find consolidated, high‑quality, course‑specific study resources. Existing solutions (group chats, random Drive folders, or paywalled sites) are fragmented, low‑signal, and don't reward contributors—creating a free‑rider dynamic and uneven quality. A campus‑scoped platform with aligned incentives is needed to increase the supply of high‑quality materials without charging cash. Finally, this application will reduce the unfair advantage held by members of some Greek life organizations that share study materials exclusively among their members.
